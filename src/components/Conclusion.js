            Now that we've seen the different types of shuffles which one should
            you adopt? In all honesty, every single shuffle has it's drawbacks,
            For the riffle split, you may end up playing with the same few cards from last round.
            For the overhand shuffle, cheating and predictability is way too easy.
            And as for the Low-Rise shuffle, who has the patience to stab two-hundred-some cards into a deck?

            <br />
            <br />
            What you should try is what I would call the 52-Mashup.
            To perform this shuffle, drop the cards onto the table face down. Then move the cards around for a few seconds.
            Once you are done moving them around, put them in a neat stack and start playing.
            Although childish in nature, its quick and simple. This has worked well enough to prevent cheating and has seen some popularity amongst casinos.
